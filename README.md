### My Projects
These are a few projects that I have done :)

## Power BI
I had never done data visualization beyond python and maybe even Matlab, so I decided to give a few of these Data Visulizations a try. I have to say, that Power Bi is reletively easy to use, or rather its very intuitive to those who have worked with Excel sheets and done some form of Data cleaning. Even though the interface seemed daunting at first, I had made my first dashboard in about an hour. 

Here is a list of Things I have tried:

## Good Doggos at the Pound <https://github.com/kpatil-7/My-projects/tree/main/Power%20Bi/Good%20Doggoes%20at%20the%20Pound>

I am a dog person... So I had to give back to the dogs who are just waiting to be adopted. My keys take aways from the project were the gender ratio of the dogs their age, breeds and how compatible they are with kids. There are just a few factors that generally influence if a dog gets adopted or not.

## Netflix watchtime
For this one I wanted to know how much content I had streamed on Netflix, what type of content it was, where there any standouts or even if there was any watching pattern I followed. 

## My Amazon Purchases 
This was a bit difficult to do, or rather swallow the amount of money I put as I shopped online.
