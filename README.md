# My Projects

This is my github profile which containing projects that I have done or am currently doing. Most of these were done so that I could understand and learn about something I don’t know, track myself and my digital footprint and make myself take a look at where all my money is going, that was not a good idea. 

While I did use some publicly available dataset on Kaggle, I have also scraped my own data from the net. I’ll try to hide any personal information that’s on it, but for the most part, I’ll share how to get your own data. The reason for this was that, one I didn’t want to violate someone’s privacy so I violated mine and two, with new laws about scraping data online, I didn’t want to go through what’s legal only to be told that it isn’t anymore. 

So, with that, here is a bunch of stuff for you to go through:

## Python
* Building a Chatbot
* Am I making money on my stocks?
* Making a keylogger and all things Cyber
* Gratuity Analysis: How much should you tip?
* Which Office Character are you?
* What do you mean: REcognizing Disposition in Sentence and Scoring Emotions
* Netflix to the rescue: Movie recommendation system
* Who said what now? Fake news detection and identification of source
* I didn't buy that! Credit Card fraud detection

## Power BI
* Good Doggos at the Pound
* Netflix Dashboard and everything bingeworthy
* Graphical representation of all of my amazon purchases
