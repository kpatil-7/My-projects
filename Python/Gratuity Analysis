Data analysis of gratuity given by customers 

No, based on the data I received, I donâ€™t think I am a gratuitous person or rather as gratuitous as I hoped to be. I used a dataset of the number of tips a person gave and compared it with the gender of the person and the day they were tipping. 
I found out that Saturday was a really good day for staff as people tend to dish out more tips, but we could easy say that a lot more people visit restaurant on Saturday. Also Tuesday, not a good day as the least number of tips is received. I also learned that people who identify as men do tend to tip more, but again, several factors could affect that decision as the dataset had a greater number of men than women this being one reason among others.
