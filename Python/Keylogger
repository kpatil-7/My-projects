Making a keylogger, tracking and analysis of keys:

I hate to admit it, but when I was younger, I had my yahoo account and then… after clicking on a questionable link and being naïve enough to have the same username and password across all websites, I did not have a yahoo account anymore, or well an account that I couldn’t get into. 
If anything, the fact that it was yahoo, should tell you about how long ago this was. Sure, at the time, I didn’t understand what happened, I just assumed that the ‘internet lost my password’ and rolled with it. 
After I got to know about cyber security, I knew I wanted to build a keylogger for myself and see how it worked. With a simple code it was pretty easy to get it up and running. Have I fallen for any more scams like these? Nope. But I would like to apologize to a ‘Jane Doe’ AKA the name I used to sus out sketchy websites to see how they worked.
