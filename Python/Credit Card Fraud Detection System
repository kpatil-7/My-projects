Credit Card Fraud Detection System

I was always on the fence about getting a credit card. I was always told that loans are bad and that I have to be responsible about my money and they banks are evil and so on. 
So naturally, I decided to do my own research on what the big deal is about them. No shock to anyone, credit cards weren’t the villain, people not knowing how to use a credit card was. 
As I kept on reading, I learnt more about building a credit history, getting returns and most importantly identify theft. 

Somewhere around August, I got an alert from my back saying that I have been getting charged the same amount from the same vendor everyday and they flagged that purchase. 
Of course, since this was happening for the first time, I didn’t think about how I used to Divvy back home everyday at the same time, but my mind immediately went towards me getting scammed and that my credit card details were on the internet. 
It also did not help that Divvy charges show up on the bill as ‘San Francisco’ and since I was not in that city, let alone the state I freaked out.

Soon enough as I frantically googled why I was being charged, I decided upon working on fraud detection system.
