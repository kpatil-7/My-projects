Recognizing disposition in sentences and scoring emotions

With the cloak of anonymity provided by the internet, people aren’t scared of being harsh on the internet event to those who never saw it coming. Because you can just sign in as guest or ‘DudeLOVEScookies11’ its easy to spread hate and being down right disrespectful. It is one of the things that I really dislike. 

Take video games for exam, depending on just the username, people are quick to judge and say mean things to you to your face. Which is what inspred this project. I did a small experiment where I changed my username to ‘Kanye’ and played ten games and compared that with a username ‘IcyOrange’. The results of that were just as I expected, with Kanye, I was kicked out of games, or immediately without even exchanging a single word, I was the bad guy and with IcyOrange, people didn’t seem to care.

With this project, I drew up three lists with positive, negative and neutral words. The goal was then to analyze the sentence as a whole, rate it and give the final disposition of the sentence.
