Movie recommendation system (AKA I’m bored and Netflix needs to fix it)

Initially, I was working on a visualization project where I analyzed everything I have watched since forever and generated a dashboard on PowerBI. 
I figured if you said that you liked a certain movie, you could cross reference the genres and the chances of you liking a similar movie would be greater. 
Yes, there is a lot to it like the director, plot, production, or even if your favorite actor is in it. But I’ll be focusing on genres.

The model is fairly simple, it asks the user to type in a movie Id, since the dataset has about a thousand entries, asking for an ID makes the task simpler and then suggesting similar movies.  
I learnt that just based on genres is not enough, we need to account for several other factors, for example, I love Deadpool, but I did not like green lantern.
