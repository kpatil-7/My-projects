## Netflix watchtime
### Introduction
For this one I wanted to know how much content I had streamed on Netflix, what type of content it was, where there any standouts or even if there was any watching pattern I followed. 

Once the pandemic hit, everyone was binging something, anything, just to make the days go by faster. I guess even before the pandy we all ever watching something or the other. 

With this project I wanted to analyze what type of shows I watched and what content I consumed. Along with this I wanted to see if I watched more content on a particular day or maybe a month? See what I preferred and what was my top rated show.  

It wasn’t a shocked that about 13% of the graph showed that Gray’s anatomy was my popular choice or rather my go to, followed by friends at a little over 10% and Schidt’s Creek at 9%
