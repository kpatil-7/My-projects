## Good Doggos at the Pound

I am a dog person... So I had to give back to the dogs who are just waiting to be adopted. 

I love puppies, in all shapes and sizes. Growing up I always insisted on getting a puppy, but I was always denied and I got a bunch of fishes instead. I still remember how I would insist on going to my uncle’s house because he used to have three Labradors and one Rottweiler. I was the only one who was pet the Rottweiler and wasn’t scared of him.

At a younger age, I thought that dogs came from a store, you go there, you pick what you want, put in your cart and off you go, just like buying cereal. But as I started volunteering at a rescue, I knew that it was much more than me picking a pup but the pup choosing me.

With Paws animal rescue, I cared for dogs took them on walks, played with them, gave them treetos and lots of love. Before I was weary of Pit bulls because of the way they are portrayed to be in a negative light, But after walking a few of them, I learnt that they are absolute sweethearts. 

This made me want to plot information about the dogs that are available for adoption and to learn more about them. As heartbreaking as it was, yes pitbulls are the number one breed that go unadopted. 

Currently, I live in a cramped space that doesn’t allow dogs, but hopefully in the future, I strive to live in a space wide enough for my buddy to live happily with a yard they deserve!


My key take aways from the project were the gender ratio of the dogs their age, breeds and how compatible they are with kids. There are just a few factors that generally influence if a dog gets adopted or not.
