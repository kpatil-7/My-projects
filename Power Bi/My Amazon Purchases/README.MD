## My Amazon Purchases 
### Introduction
I recently moved, and not just cities but countries. 

So, I had to shop for almost everything. From mattress to a shower caddy to three am snacks. Since I moved from my masters, majority of the time I was at school, I had decided to order stuff to my place. I don’t have a car and amazon prime just made things easier. 

At the end of the month when I sat down to clear my dues and took a look at where all my money went, I was shook. It possibly couldn’t be that I ordered so much stuff can it now? Which is why I decided to scrape my own data and visualize what category was more frequented and by what percent. 

This was a bit difficult to do, or rather swallow the amount of money I put as I shopped online.
