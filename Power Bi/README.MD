## Power BI

1) Adopt a Dog!

I love puppies, in all shapes and sizes. Growing up I always insisted on getting a puppy, but I was always denied and I got a bunch of fishes instead. I still remember how I would insist on going to my uncle’s house because he used to have three Labradors and one Rottweiler. I was the only one who was pet the Rottweiler and wasn’t scared of him.

At a younger age, I thought that dogs came from a store, you go there, you pick what you want, put in your cart and off you go, just like buying cereal. But as I started volunteering at a rescue, I knew that it was much more than me picking a pup but the pup choosing me.

With Paws animal rescue, I cared for dogs took them on walks, played with them, gave them treetos and lots of love. Before I was weary of Pit bulls because of the way they are portrayed to be in a negative light, But after walking a few of them, I learnt that they are absolute sweethearts. 

This made me want to plot information about the dogs that are available for adoption and to learn more about them. As heartbreaking as it was, yes pitbulls are the number one breed that go unadopted. 

Currently, I live in a cramped space that doesn’t allow dogs, but hopefully in the future, I strive to live in a space wide enough for my buddy to live happily with a yard they deserve!

2) Graphical representation of my amazon purchases:

I recently moved, and not just cities but countries. So, I had to shop for almost everything. From mattress to a shower caddy to three am snacks. Since I moved from my masters, majority of the time I was at school, I had decided to order stuff to my place. I don’t have a car and amazon prime just made things easier. 
At the end of the month when I sat down to clear my dues and took a look at where all my money went, I was shook. It possibly couldn’t be that I ordered so much stuff can it now? Which is why I decided to scrape my own data and visualize what category was more frequented and by what percent. 

3) My Netflix dashboard and everything I watched since forever
Once the pandemic hit, everyone was binging something, anything, just to make the days go by faster. I guess even before the pandy we all ever watching something or the other. With this project I wanted to analyze what type of shows I watched and what content I consumed. Along with this I wanted to see if I watched more content on a particular day or maybe a month? See what I preferred and what was my top rated show.  
It wasn’t a shocked that about 13% of the graph showed that Gray’s anatomy was my popular choice or rather my go to, followed by friends at a little over 10% and Schidt’s  Creek at 9%
