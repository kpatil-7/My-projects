I had never done data visualization beyond python and maybe even Matlab, so I decided to give a few of these Data Visulizations a try. I have to say, that Power Bi is reletively easy to use, or rather its very intuitive to those who have worked with Excel sheets and done some form of Data cleaning. Even though the interface seemed daunting at first, I had made my first dashboard in about an hour.
