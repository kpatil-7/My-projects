## Danfy 

During my time taking a course titled "Science of Programming" I had the chance to learn about the differences of verification and testing and what all goes into defining specs.
I spent time getting to know about termination of programs, loop bounds, loop invarients, pratial and total correctness, and much more.

Dafny was a tool we used to check if the loop founds were true thorugh out the program.
Here are a few programs I worked on:

1) Find the greatest number in Array
2) Calculate the square of a number 
3) Check if number of positive numbers is equare to the number of negetive numbers
4) Work out the sum of all the elements of an array
